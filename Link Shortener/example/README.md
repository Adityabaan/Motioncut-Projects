## Overview
During the internship at **MotionCut Technologies**, I developed a **Link Shortener Application**. This application allows users to convert long URLs into shorter, more manageable links. The primary focus of the project was to enhance user experience and demonstrate core Java programming skills.

### Features of the Application:
- Generate short links for long URLs.
- Retrieve original links using the shortened version.
- Basic validation for URL inputs.
