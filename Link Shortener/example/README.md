## Overview🌟
During the internship at **MotionCut Technologies**, I developed a **Link Shortener Application**. This application allows users to convert long URLs into shorter, more manageable links. The primary focus of the project was to enhance user experience and demonstrate core Java programming skills.

### Features of the Application:
- 🔗 Generate short links for long URLs.
- 📂 Retrieve original links using the shortened version.
- ✅ Basic validation for URL inputs.

### Description:
- **src/**: Contains the Java source code for the application, including main and test files.
- **Reports/**: Includes detailed documentation of the application, its architecture, and testing outcomes.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Programming Language**: Java ☕
- **Development Tools**: IntelliJ IDEA, Maven
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## How to Use 🖥️

1. Open the project in Apache NetBeans IDE.
2. Build the project using Maven or your IDE's build tool.
3. Run the `LinkShortener.java` file to start the application.
4. Use test cases in `LinkShortenerTest.java` to validate functionality.
